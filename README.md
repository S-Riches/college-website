# College website [D@RKNET GAMES]
This is my college assignment submission for my website development unit

# Note for anyone who's seen the video in the code:
In the original code I had intended to add a video that plays in the background, and while it worked locally, the hosting service my college used didnt allow it to be hosted. Ive excluded it from this repo as the file is quite large and is unable to be hosted by github.
